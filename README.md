# A todo app as a demo
A client build with Typescript and Vue and an API build with Java and Spring Boot.

## todos (oh, the irony)
 * [ ] update ci docker image to use dind (see Spring Boot for inspiration)
 * [ ] simple ship script
 * [ ] integrate e2e into ship script
 * [ ] fail ship script on local changes
 * [ ] fail ship script if behind upstream
 * [ ] auth w/ (embedded) ldap
 * [ ] API integration tests w/ rest assured
 * [ ] deploy
