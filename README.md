A client build with Typescript and Vue and an API build with Java and Spring Boot.

 * [ ] auth [ w/ (embedded) ldap ]
 * [ ] update ci docker image to use dind (see Spring Boot for inspiration)
 * [x] simple ship script
 * [x] integrate e2e into ship script
 * [ ] fail ship script on local changes
 * [ ] fail ship script if behind upstream
 * [ ] deploy
